## 📝 Overview of project
This is an application build during the Api-digest-2021

The application uses a [_'RickAndMorty'_](https://rickandmortyapi.com) api.

On the main screen, there are _cards_ which display basic character info.

User can navigate back and forth among the different pages to view all characters.

There is a family tree for the Smith family which also shows character info upon clicking on a certain image.

#### Future Scope
We intend to add a filter feature which will allow user to search for a character just by name, species, status(DOA) etc.

Add the location and episode views.
