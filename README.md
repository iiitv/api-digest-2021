# API Digest 2021
The idea is to create a Telegram Bot for running the code inside Telegram, written in messages. The code has to be written in the message and the bot will return the output. The user can add its username in the bot to receive its details in messages like rating, number of stars etc.

We will be using APIs from Codechef, Codeforces or Hackerrank to fetch a random question from any category/difficulty level.

Further, we will try to introduce more features like fetching a random question daily according to user's rating, alert about the upcoming contests and solving language specific ladders.

### Steps to Run 
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/anaghamittal/api-digest-2021/`.
2. Go to the folder `team#17-education`.
3. Run `server.py` using `python server.py`.
4. Use the Bot :)
