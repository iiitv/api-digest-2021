# Inferno - Gaming Website
<br/>
Inferno is like a library for the people for who like to know about the most popular games, get their ratings and reviews and even see their screenshots! ðŸ¤©<br/>
Not only this they can also search for any game they wish to play and buy them from available play stores!<br/>
We have implemented the above idea using the following public API : <br/>
https://rawg.io/apidocs <br/>
https://www.framer.com/api/motion/<br/>
